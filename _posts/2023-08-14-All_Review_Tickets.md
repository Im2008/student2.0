Week 1: Pretty difficult to get started with since my chromebook was slow, however I was able to get the server running and was able to access a lot of stuff

Week 2: Server started breaking down for some reason, however I got help from Matthew and was able to get stuff working and was able to work on the Snake game yet really late, like on Friday.

Week 3: Worked on the snake game, also made an extra tic tac toe game just incase I needed some credit for another game.

Week 4: Continued to work on the snake game, finished it by Wednesday and was able to get started on the other games such as Game of Life & organizing my notebook

Week 5: I used ChatGPT for Game of Life and was able to work more efficiently since my notebook was more organized, I put the review tickets only in 1 markdown instead of multiple because it put way too much files into my repository and lagged my computer a lot.

Week 6: Worked on the calculator and did a lot of stuff that did well. Although it does still look pretty wacky, it still worked out pretty well.

Week 7: Worked into pairs for the calculator, and it worked out pretty well and efficiently, started working on the mario game for the rest so theres no other reflections.

Week 8-(end): Most of the things were on a different repository.
