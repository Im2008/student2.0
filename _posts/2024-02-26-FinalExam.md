<h1> General Overview of LVL 4 </h1>

<p> What i've added in the lvl 4 was that I changed the look of the levels compared to the other levels. This includes the sprite animation, the background, the platforms, & the side background.  </p>

<h1> Snake Game</h1>

<p> The snake game I mostly added "wasd" keys and made it along with arrows keys. This game helped me learn an overview of javascript even though I still didn't get at the beginning of trimester 2.</p>

<h1> Game of Life</h1>

<p> The Game of life is a simulation game of a blob and it spreads out the more it works. This was a really fun project as it was a distinct version of the snake game basically, but it was more defined javascript code, and it made me learn a bit more about buttons even though buttons aren't really javascript. </p>
