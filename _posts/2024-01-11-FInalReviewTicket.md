<h1>Final Review Ticket for the MiniProject (Mario Platformer)</h1>
<p> final review ticket before switching groups. Partnered with Trystan, Matthew, Gavin (Came later in our group), and me (Ian). Overall this was a pretty challenging project, for me at least, as I forgot to put a lot of stuff into my home repo and instead put too much stuff into our shared repo which made me fall really behind. Towards the end though, I was able to clone the teacher repository and be able to catch up with grading and stuff. </p>
